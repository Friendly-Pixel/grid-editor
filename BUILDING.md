How to build grid-editor
========================

Do NOT make changes to the files in the `dist` directory. 

Instead, update the files in the `src` directory. Then install the dependencies:

* `npm install`

From then on out, you can build the files in the `dist` directory by running:

* `npm run build`

During development, you can also run `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild on changes.
